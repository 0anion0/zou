## Zou is the memory of your CG production

Zou is an API that allows to store and manage the data of your CG production.
Through it you can link all the tools of your pipeline and make sure they are
all synchronized. 

To integrate it quickly in your tools you can rely on the dedicated Python
client 
named [Gazu](https://gazu.cg-wire.com).

### Features 

Zou can:

* Store production data: projects, shots, assets, tasks, files
  metadata and validations.
* Provide folder and file paths for any task.
* Data import from Shotgun or CSV files.
* Export main data to CSV files.
* Provide helpers to manage task workflow (start, publish, retake).
* Listen to events to plug external modules on it.


### Installation and documentation

Installation of Zou itself is pretty straightforward but it requires the setup
of third-parties tool like a database instance. So we recommend you to jump
directly to the full documentation:
